## Do I have to pay for consuming posts from Bluesky?
No! That's why this tutorial makes sense. In the good old days it was possible to consume data from Twitter with very few restrictions, but it's not the case anymore. By using Bluesky as an alternative, developers, hackers and anybody with basic CS background can start processing textual data, which is a real analytics goldmine.

Bluesky aims to support an open and decentralized ecosystem, with no cost barriers for accessing the API

## Okay... but which are the rates?
Official max rates can be found here link, but a summary is provided below.

* 3K requests per 5 mins per IP address
* ~1.5K posts per hour per account and a max of ~11.5K per day
* 30 sessions per 5 mins and a max of 300 per day
* 100 accounts per minute per IP address

It is possible to run your own Personal Data Server (PDS) as a developer, where your own limits can be applied to hosted accounts.
